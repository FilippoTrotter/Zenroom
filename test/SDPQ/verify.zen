Scenario 'qp' : verify SD-JWT signature
Scenario 'sd_jwt' : verify HMACs and disclosures 

# Here we load the Issuer's pubkey, which may be retrieved from a DID document
Given I have a 'mldsa44 public key' from 'The Issuer'

# Here we load the Presentation in SD-JWT format
Given I have a 'pq signed selective disclosure' named 'sd-jwt presentation'

When I verify pq signed selective disclosure 'sd-jwt presentation' issued by 'The Issuer' is valid

# If the verification is successful, a cheerful string is printed. Else, prepare for a BSOD. 
Then print the string 'Verification of Presentation was successful!'
